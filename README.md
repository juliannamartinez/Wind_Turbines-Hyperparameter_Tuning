# Wind_Turbines-Hyperparameter_Tuning
Analysis of wind generator sensor data to build classification models to help identify generator failures in advance before the machine fails/breaks.

### Project Description:

This dataset contains wind turbine sensor data from a (fake) company called "ReneWind". The objective for this data is to utilize machine learning to improve the machinery/processes ivolved in the production of wind energy based on the failure of the wind turbines. The objective of the project is to build various classification models, tune them and find the best one that will help identify failures in advance so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.

### Skills:

Up and Downsampling, Regularization, Hyperparameter Tuning, Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate Analysis, Bi-Variate Analysis), Python

## This project contains 1 file:

Full notebook (Wind_Turbine_Predictive_Maintenance_project_FULL_NOTEBOOK.ipynb)

> This notebook contains the entirety of the project including all of the code to perform a run-down of the data/datatypes, exploratory data analysis, and all insights and observations. This file contains all variations/tests of classification models with various pruning methods. The final/best model utilizes a tuned random forest classifier technique. The final (best) model (image below of confusions matrix figure) is at the bottom of the notebook with the conclusions and actionable insights.

### Libraries used:

imblearn, sklearn, xgboost, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
